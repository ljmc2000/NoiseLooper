* All sounds cropped to 6 seconds or less (the application can only play 6 seconds of a sound anyway). This should drastically reduce the install size on disk.
* The sleep timer is now syncronized to the system clock (before it would have been inaccurate by at least a millisecond on every second)
* The sleep timer can now be canceled
* The credits screen is now a webview with hyperlinks to download all included sounds
* Sounds are unloaded when removed from the custom list which should prevent the soundpool from hitting it's limit if a user repeatedly adds and removes custom sounds.
